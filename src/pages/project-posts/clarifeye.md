# Background

# Problem Space & Needs Statement

Navigating the complex urban landscapes poses a significant challenge for the close to 300M people worldwide with severe visual impairment (VI). Although traditional aids like white canes and guide dogs are able to help individuals with VI navigate around obstacles, they lack the capability to communicate to users about the identity of these obstacles. This gap in information not only hampers safe and efficient navigation but also restricts the user's ability to independently interact with their surroundings.

Our project aims to design a real-time device to address the challenge of outdoor obstacle identification for individuals with severe visual impairment that can be used alongside traditional aids (e.g. guide dogs and canes) to enhance the userâ€™s ability to make informed decisions about their routes and increases their confidence and independence in outdoor navigation.

# Goals

- **Goal 1:** Improve decision making:
    - **Metric:** Accuracy & precision of object identification
    - **Metric:** Speed of decision making - measure the time it takes for a user to make an informed decision after receiving the identification alert
    - **Metric:** Quality of decision making - assess how often users make the correct or safer decision when informed about the type of obstacle in a given obstacle course
- **Goal 2:** User Confidence
    - **Metric:** Conduct user surveys to gauge the level of confidence they feel while using the system
